Config.json file !
===============================================================================
This file contains :
Hologram Id: This ID is a device key generated through the hologram website and each hologram device has its own ID. The config.jason file has to match with the 
             hologram ID for syncronization and network connectivity.
Camera Id: Each camera has its seperate ID.   
Treatment: These cameras are designed to run on two treatment types BARE or COVER
Crop: These cameras are designed to run on two crops CORN or SOYBEAN as we have designed the machinhe learning models on these two crops only till now.
Test Ml : If it is false it uses the pictures which the camera has taken during its run time
          If its given true the camera uses the test images which are stiored in the camera for evaluation.
Mode: The cameras can run on four modes namely start,stop,defualt or setup command.

Rep: it is the repitition and it can be either 1 or 2.
ver: version of the camera which is 5.18.21(firmware version its is the image date and used to track issues).

Soybean ML model
===============================================================================
The three files of soybean is the machine learning model made on tensor flow. It has the test labels and test images for the evaluation. The cotton machine learning model 
will be made soon as well.
